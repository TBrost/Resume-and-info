Its primary abilities are as follows:\n\nAccesses an Amazon S3 Bucket through Amazons API service.\nDynamically loads new files to local machine\nWrangles and cleans files using time stamp and function call data to calculate active user time and usage data metrics.\nSaves resulting clean files as partitioned and compressed parquet files in an Amazon S3 server while preserving a local machine backup\n\n\n\nBuilt a large scale Power-BI dashboard for SAAS data analytics, allowing the customer service and client leadership to quickly understand and learn the trends in usage and client activity for new and existing clients.\n\nWorked extensively to coordinate expectations and results of graphical and tabular summaries between the client and my team to ensure both the clients outlined and underlying needs were met and exceeded when possible.\nDeveloped secondary script in R that loads and aggregates a customizable range of historical cleaned data from the partitioned clean data stored in Amazon S3 into Power BI.\nLead project team through a change in the primary metric of measurement as the needs of the client became more apparent during the duration of our project\n\n\n\nResearched, tested and implemented fully automated systems provided by windows OS and the Microsoft Power Suite to schedule all scripts, datasets, reports, and dashboards to refresh weekly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArranged through the Research and Business Development Center Based out of Rexburg, ID\nJan 2023 - Apr 2023\nWorked as part of a small team to study and examine consumer data before building an interactive data exploration application embedded into a website for the client. (More Details)\n\n\nData AnalysisApplication\n\n\nWorked with another project member to trial methods of trend and spike identification within consumer patterns.\n\n\nTook primary dashboard built by the rest of the team and overhauled it by adding user interactive selection, searching, and filtering features before converting it into a web hosted report dashboard easily share-able and accessible to members within the clients organization."
